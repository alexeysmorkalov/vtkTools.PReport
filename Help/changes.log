New features:
  Print engine:
    - added new link modes of objects:
      Width of object depends on total change of width of linked objects
      Height of object depends on total change of height of linked objects
      They are demonstated in demo (on last page):
         DEMO\Demos\14 - New objects links modes\NewLinkModes
    - added new property ResetPagesCount at TprGenBandInfo object,
      you can use it in OnBandGenerateCell event,
      to manipulate by pages numbering. See demo:
         DEMO\Demos\16 - Change page numbering
    - added new property GroupValue at TprGroup object, which returns 
      current value of group.
      You can use this property in report template, for example in 
      TprMemoObj:
      [prGroup1.GroupValue()] See demo:
         DEMO\Demos\15 - Grouped TprDataset
    - added new method
      function TprVariables.AddVariable(const AVariableName: string; 
                                        const AVariableValue: Variant): TprVariable;
      If variable is not exists, adds it with specified name and value,
      if variable exists function change it value.
  Removed bugs:
    - The borders with width more than one are incorrectly shown in
      preview and at printing.
    - If DecimalSeparator is not [.] (point) errors in parser are occured
      at use of floating-point numbers.
