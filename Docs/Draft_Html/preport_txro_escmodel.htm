    <td> <p>As is known the majority of printers which can print in a text mode have 
      the special sets of commands which allow to switch style of a font, line 
      spacings and so on. Each such command is represented by the special sequence 
      of several symbols. Windows does not contain the support of such commands. 
      Therefore the special mechanism for the description of such commands and 
      their translations between various models of printers has been developed. 
      </p><p>As a rule, printers of various firms have the different sets of commands 
      (for example, for printers EPSON the command for italic font will consist 
      of two symbols - #27#52, for printers Hewlett Packard the 5 symbols - #27#40#115#49#83). 
      The PReport must print the report on any printer, certainly, can be so, 
      that some printer does not support the command, and such command should 
      be ignored.</p> <p>PReport has the special list of the supported commands, each 
      command is defined by:
	  <ul> <li>The unique name.</li><li>The description (the simple text 
      description).</li><li>The unique prefix.</li></ul>
      The generated report contains these prefixes, and at a printing they are 
      translated in native commands of the printer the <strong>TprESCModel</strong> 
      class is used for translation, this class contains the recode table and 
      uses the command's prefix for searching a native printer's command. The 
      separate command is represented by the <strong>TprCommand</strong> class.</p>
