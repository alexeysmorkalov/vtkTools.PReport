      <strong>Introduction</strong> 
      <p><strong>PReport</strong> &#8211; report generator for Delphi and C++Builder. 
        It is written on Object Pascal, can be used with Borland Delphi 4-7 and 
        Borland C ++ Builder 5-6.<br>
        As against other report generators PReport can be used not only for generation 
        standard graphic Windows reports, but also for generation of the <strong>text 
        reports</strong> for fast printing on <strong>matrix printers</strong>. 
        <br>
        Components list:</p>
      <p> <img src="Images/TprReport.GIF" width="24" height="24"><strong>TprReport</strong><br>
        Provides functionality for creation the graphic Windows reports, like 
        FastReport, QuickReport, ReportBuilder and so on.<br>
        <img src="Images/TprTxReport.GIF" width="24" height="24"><strong>TprTxReport</strong><br>
        Provides functionality for creation the text reports for printing on matrix 
        printers.<br>
        <img src="Images/TprMlRes.GIF" width="24" height="24"><strong>TprMLRes</strong><br>
        TprMLRes is a non visual component, which can replace contents of the 
        components properties with values stored in resources, used for supporting 
        various languages.<br>
        <img src="Images/TprStringsDataset.GIF" width="24" height="24"><strong>TprStringsDataset</strong><br>
        Non visual component derived from TprDataset allows using list of strings 
        (TStrings object) as a dataset in the PReport. <br>
        <img src="Images/TprEventsDataset.GIF" width="24" height="24"><strong>TprEventsDataset</strong><br>
        Non visual component derived from TprDataset, allows writing dataset logic 
        with using of Delphi events.<br>
        <img src="Images/TprDesignerPanel.GIF" width="24" height="24"><strong>TprDesignerPanel</strong><br>
        Represents the control for editing the TprReport template. On the basis 
        of this component the report designer for TprReport is created.<br>
        <img src="Images/TprTxDesignerPanel.GIF" width="24" height="24"><strong>TprTxDesignerPanel</strong><br>
        Represents the control for editing the TprTxReport template. On the basis 
        of this component the report designer for TprTxReport is created.<br>
        <img src="Images/TprPreviewPanel.GIF" width="24" height="24"><strong>TprPreviewPanel</strong><br>
        Represents the control for preview the report generated by the TprReport 
        component. On the basis of this component the preview window for TprReport 
        is created.<br>
        <img src="Images/TprTxPreviewPanel.GIF" width="24" height="24"><strong>TprTxPreviewPanel</strong><br>
        Represents the control for preview the report generated by the TprTxReport 
        component. On the basis of this component the preview window for TprTxReport 
        is created.</p>
      <p><br>
        TprReport and TprTxReport classes are derived from TprCustomReport, which 
        contains all logic of the report generating. The derived classes provide 
        functionality for: report designing, preview and printing.</p>
		<p>
        Main features of the report engine (supported for Windows and text reports):</p>
		<ul>
		<li> <strong>Cross-tab reports</strong>, any band can be printed vertically. 
          For example, on each page the vertical PageHeader can be printed, the 
          vertical grouping is supported; the width of vertical bands can be dynamically 
          changed etc. </li>
		<li> <strong>Objects can have many views.</strong> Each view has condition, 
          which determines when view is used. See demo </li>
        <li> <strong>Objects can dynamically resize.</strong> For example the 
          size of band will be automatically increased or decreased depending 
          on sizes of objects, contained in it, objects can change the sizes and 
          position concerning each other. </li>
        <li><strong>Links between bands can be defined.</strong> It can be used 
          to avoid such situations at which the group footer is printed on new 
          page without the data (detail band). </li>
		<li> <strong>All aggregated values (group summary, report summary and 
          so on) can be used in any place, where their significance can be shown.</strong> 
          For example, the group summary can be shown not only in group footer, 
          but also in a group title, in detail band, to which the given group 
          is linked. But this total, certainly, can not be shown in a title of 
          the report, the total under the report can be shown anywhere. </li>
        <li> <strong>Unlimited amount of the enclosed groups.</strong> </li>
        <li> <strong>Master-detail reports.</strong> </li>
        <li> <strong>The columns can go not only from top - down and at the left 
          - to the right, but also at the left - to the right and top-down.</strong> 
        </li>
        <li> <strong>Virtual datasets (TprDataset) are supported.</strong> The 
          detail band can be linked not only to a TDataset component, but also 
          to TprDataset. The components - intermediaries, for example as TppBDEDatasourse 
          in ReportBuilder, aren't necessary. </li>
		<li> <strong>Tracking user actions at preview window.</strong> Moving 
          mouse over object double clicks and so on. </li>
		</ul>
      <p></p>
      <p>TprReport</p>
	  <ul>
        <li><strong>Advanced preview window.</strong> Search of the text, mouse 
          scrolling, mouse wheel support and so on. </li>
        <li><strong>Export to the XLS and HTML formats</strong> (without OLE or 
          DDE).</li>
        <li><strong>End-user can edit generated report.</strong></li>
	  </ul>
      <p>TprTxReport</p>
	  <ul>
        <li><strong>Full-functionality designer</strong>, same as at TprReport. 
        </li>
        <li><strong>Various text styles supported</strong>. Italic, bold and so 
          on. </li>
        <li><strong>Developer can define custom ESC commands.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Pseudographics supported.</strong></li>
	  </ul>
